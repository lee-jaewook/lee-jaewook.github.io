# Question
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.  

**Exmaple 1**
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```
**Exmaple 2**
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```
**Exmaple 3**
```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

# My solution
I solved this problem using slicing.
```python
import re
new_string = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]",s).lower()
return new_string == newstring[::-1]
```
By filtering unnecessary characters with a regular expression(`re.sub()`), the string `s` was filtered out to alphanumeric string `new_string` at a time, and then the string was reversed using `[::-1]`.

# Best solution
My code to solve the problem cannot be called 'algorithm'. So
